Image Processing and Deep learning

## Description
Strawberries are grown for their economic value in over 70 nations, and their cultivation is an international industry. Particularly during the chilly winter months, greenhouse cultivation has become an essential tactic to maximise growth conditions and prolong supply periods. But there are drawbacks to the regulated environment of greenhouses as well. For example, the high humidity and temperature conditions make strawberry crops more susceptible to disease. It becomes essential to identify diseases quickly in order to reduce risks and preserve ideal growing circumstances. Diseases pose a threat to strawberry farming's economic viability despite advances in technology, resulting in lower yields, deteriorated fruit quality, and higher production costs.

The goal of this project is to discover diseases in strawberries by using image segmentation algorithms to analyse the fruit, blossoms, and leaves. This strategy uses image segmentation algorithms to provide a quick and precise way to identify diseases, allowing for prompt management and intervention. By lowering production costs, preserving fruit quality, and increasing crop yield, the deployment of such technologies can support the long-term viability of greenhouse strawberry farming.
